  This is a supabase and next.js website where we are hamdling data of users with three roles 
  TEACHER
  STUDENT
  HEAD TEACHER

  All of them are linked together to a School id and each profile has its own uuid .

  The students can see their progress in each subject the teachers can see the progress oof students of their own subject  and the Head Teacher can see progress of evry student in its school . 
  Right now there is no way of entering data in the websit but it can create users with different roles . 
  To make it secure the teacher and headTeacher roles are only assigned when the user enters a speacial passcode for it 
  teacher -0011
  headteacher-0022

  But right now you can see the passcodes while siging in it is only for the show purpose .

  The ui is very basic doing its job for just displaying information.
